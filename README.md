# Code-by-chapter
This repository contains _most_ of the code _**Ethical Hacking: A Hands-on Intoduction to Breaking In**_. A few chapters have _"code challenges"_ that are not in the repository. 

# There is now a wiki
Currently, the wiki contained in this repository has a set-up (Chapter 01) guide for some of the most common issue found in the discord server. There will be updates to this wiki page as new problems are found.
You can find the wiki here https://github.com/The-Ethical-Hacking-Book/Code-by-chapter/wiki Special Thanks to Nomad Nightmare for putting this together.
