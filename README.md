# Code-by-chapter
This repository contains _most_ of the code _**Ethical Hacking: A Hands-on Intoduction to Breaking In**_. A few chapters have _"code challenges"_ that are not in the repository. 

# There is now a wiki
Currently, the wiki contained in this repository has a set-up (Chapter 01) guide for some of the most common issue found in the discord server. There will be updates to this wiki page as new problems are found.
